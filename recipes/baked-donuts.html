    <h4>When my family visited before our Halloween trip to Japan, I baked them some pumpkin spice donuts!</h4>
    
    <p>I followed <a href="https://www.katiebirdbakes.com/baked-pumpkin-donuts-with-maple-glaze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this recipe</a> from <em>Katiebird Bakes</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I did cheat a little... I used a Betty Crocker spice cake mix as the base of my donuts! And added some of my <a href="../recipes/pumpkin-spice.html">homemade pumpkin spice mix</a> for some extra autumnal spice.</li>
        <li>I sprinkled autumnal leaf sprinkles on the icing of half the donuts.</li>
        <li>And sprinkled <em>Bird & Blend</em> spooky sprinkles on the other half!</li>
      </ul>
    <p>They went down a treat!</p>
