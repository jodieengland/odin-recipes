    <h4>This Christmas, I decided to make some oat cookies with a homemade pumpkin spice mix I had leftover from Halloween!</h4>
    
    <p>Oat cookies are so quick and easy to make, and they're always sooo tasty!</p>
    <p>I followed <a href="https://www.tamingtwins.com/oatmeal-cookies-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-9845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this recipe</a> from <em>Taming Twins</em>, but with a few differences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of using unsalted butter, I just used salted butter because that's all I had in my fridge. I didn't add any extra salt to the recipe because of this.</li>
        <li>Instead of just adding ground cinnamon, I instead added 1/2 tsp of my own <a href="../recipes/pumpkin-spice.html">homemade pumpkin spice mix</a>.</li>
        <li>Instead of adding raisins (I really <strong>hate</strong> raisins...) I added 75g of a mix of chocolate chips, caramel pieces and mini fudge pieces. These caramelised in the oven so nicely!</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I was so happy with how the cookies turned out! They were soft, chewy and delicious, and went down an absolute treat on Christmas Day with our morning tea!</p>
