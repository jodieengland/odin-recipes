    <h4>A super easy pumpkin spice mix that you can add to just about anything!</h4>
    
    <p>In my household, pumpkin spice season is <strong>every season.</strong></p>
    <p>I use this spice mix for so many different things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a baking ingredient, like in my <a href="../recipes/oat-cookies.html">Pumpkin Spice Oat Cookies</a> and my <a href="../recipes/baked-donuts.html">Baked Pumpkin Spice Donuts with Maple Glaze</a>.</li>
        <li>Mixed into my morning matcha for a cosy autumnal tea.</li>
        <li>Sprinkled on vegetables with a little olive oil and sea salt before roasting, for a little extra spice.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp. ground cinnamon (I used sweet ground cinnamon)</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 tsp. nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together all the spices listed above.</li>
        <li>That's it. That's literally it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's as easy as that! I added mine to a cute mason jar and created a custom label to remind myself what I put in it.
        I totally recommend creating your own spice mixes!
