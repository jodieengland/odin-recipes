# Odin Recipes

## Description
This project was created alongside [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) Foundations Course, which I used to build preliminary web development skills.

It is a basic website built on HTML only, as a learning tool to build my HTML skills.

## Credit and Acknowledgement
